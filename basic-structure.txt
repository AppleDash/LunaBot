This is an IRC bot (duh).

It maintains a global list of objects (tuples?), (tentatively) called handlers.
Each handler contains a string name, a numeric priority value, a regex, and a function.

The mane loop works like this:
- read a line from the server
- for each handler in the global list:
    - if the line matches the handler's regex:
        - call the handler's function, passing in the line (and maybe some other things, later)
